django-editregions
==================

Editable regions in templates, editable through the standard Django
admin and database-query efficient.

A bit like django-cms placeholders, but sacrificing much of their
goodness.

Depends on allsorts of not-on-pypi things I've written:

* django-helpfulfields
* django-adminlinks

More flexible with:

* django-moreloaders
